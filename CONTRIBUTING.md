  - Ideas to enhance the project. I am open to hearing ways on how to make this project more interesting, and it is a great way to learn the technologies used to make the project

  - Refactoring tips/ways to improve the performance and reliablity of this project. I'm still early in my coding journey, so I would appreciate any tips to improve how I write my software

  - THere are almost certainly other things i'm forgetting, so if you are interested in contributions you can open an issue with whatever questions/comments you have


### Future plans & Contribution Ideas

This project was ultimately made for me to learn how to build REST apis, and most of the changes I make now are just for entertainment. Here are some plans that I may decide to make 
  in the future. Feel free to choose one of these, or any ideas you have yourself, to contribute:
  
  - Options trading. This will be built of the Black-Scholes model of options, which is a way of calculating european option prices

  - Adding the ability to trade index funds

  - A series of trading bots. The idea here would be to create them seperately following the microservice architecture, and have them interact with the API through HTTP calls.
    I would probably add different types of bots that serve different purposes or are more heavily optimized to see which one performs best.
    
  - Improvements in company earnings. To build off of this, earnings would have a large affect on the grade of the stock, and perhaps there could be more values that are used
    to grade stocks, with each value having an affect on price movements. 
    
### Code of Conduct

If you decide to contribute, please be respectful of all fellow participants. This project was ultimately made to help me improve my coding skills, so I want to keep this environment open to
