### Future plans & Contribution Ideas

This project was ultimately made for me to learn how to build REST apis, and most of the changes I make now are just for entertainment. Here are some plans that I may decide to make 
  in the future. Feel free to choose one of these, or any ideas you have yourself, to contribute:
  
  - Options pricing. This will be built of the Black-Scholes model of options, which is a way of calculating european option prices
